# DND-Beyond-Data-Exporter
Export character features as a PDF for offline use.

I want to be able to export my D&D beyond content to a PDF for use around the table, for myself and also for my home-game players. So I wrote this extension: once installed, you'll have another option in the drop-down to export all of your character's features, feats, and spells to a PDF for easy access, so you don't have to bring a laptop to use D&D beyond at the table if you don't want to.

Please open an issue on github if you notice any problems.
